       1.  Dependency 'androidx.fragment:fragment:1.7.1' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 34 or later of the
           Android APIs.

           :flutter_keyboard_visibility is currently compiled against android-31.

           Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
           of at least 34, for example 36.

           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
