Potential fix: Your project's AGP 
version is typically defined in 
the plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` file (C:\GoTogeth
er\gotogether\mobile_flutter\androi
d/settings.gradle), by a plugin 
with the id of 
com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, 
your project was likely created 
with an older template version. In 
this case it is most likely 
defined in the top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\GoTogether\go
together\mobile_flutter\android/bui
ld.gradle) by the following line 
in the dependencies block of the 
buildscript: "classpath 'com.androi
d.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".

Warning: Flutter support for your 
project's Kotlin version (1.9.24) 
will soon be dropped. Please 
upgrade your Kotlin version to a 
version of at least 2.1.0 soon.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP 
version is typically defined in 
the plugins block of the

with the id of 
org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block,
