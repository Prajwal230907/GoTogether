bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP 
version is typically defined in the 
plugins block of the `settings.gradle` 
file (C:\GoTogether\gotogether\mobile_flu
tter\android/settings.gradle), by a 
plugin with the id of 
com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your 
project was likely created with an older 
template version. In this case it is 
most likely defined in the top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\GoTogether\gotogeth
er\mobile_flutter\android/build.gradle) 
by the following line in the 
dependencies block of the buildscript: 
"classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradl
e:<version>'".

Warning: Flutter support for your 
project's Kotlin version (1.9.24) will 
soon be dropped. Please upgrade your 
Kotlin version to a version of at least 
2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-sk

Potential fix: Your project's KGP 
version is typically defined in the 
plugins block of the `settings.gradle` 
file (C:\GoTogether\gotogether\mobile_flu
tter\android/settings.gradle), by a 
plugin with the id of 
org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your 
project was likely created with an older 
template version, in which case it is 
most likely defined in the top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\GoTogether\gotogeth

by the ext.kotlin_version property.

Your project is configured to compile 
against Android SDK 34, but the 
following plugin(s) require to be 
compiled against a higher Android SDK 
version:
- flutter_native_splash compiles against 
Android SDK 35
- flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle 
compiles against Android SDK 36
- geolocator_android compiles against 
Android SDK 36
- image_picker_android compiles against 
Android SDK 36
- path_provider_android compiles against 
Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the 
highest Android SDK version (they are 
backward compatible).
Add the following to C:\GoTogether\gotoge
ther\mobile_flutter\android\app\build.gra
dle.kts:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
